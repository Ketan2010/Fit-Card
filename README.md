# FitCard

It is too tedious for patients to maintain all the medical reports and if the individual is prone to such kind of disease which requires a regular health check up it becomes more difficult to handle a large amount of reports. And if the hard copy is misplaced by chance, patients are asked to again perform a test. Which involves spending of money twice for the same thing. And if any intermediate report is lost, the doctors cannot give accurate consultancy about the treatment.
A card with barcode and unique code to carry while consulting doctors. On password protected scanning it will generate digitally stored reports, medical history and eradicate handling hard copies. If customized, it can give alerts for regular checkups.
